Disease Prediction and Medical Recommendation System.


 Introduction
The Disease Prediction and Medical Recommendation System uses machine learning techniques to predict
 diseases based on input symptoms by the patient. It provides recommendations for medications, diets, and workouts tailored to specific diseases.
  The project uses a dataset from Kaggle comprising symptoms, diseases, medications, and other medical attributes to train and evaluate machine learning models.

Project Overview
The project files are organized into the following directories:

 
  kaggle_dataset
 	     `description.csv`: Descriptions of diseases.
    	`diets.csv`: Recommended diets for diseases.
     	`medications.csv`: Medications prescribed for diseases.
 	    `precautions_df.csv`: Precautions to be taken for diseases.
 	    `Symptom-severity.csv`: Severity of symptoms.
 	     `symptoms_df.csv`: Symptoms with corresponding disease labels.
     	`Training.csv`: Dataset for training machine learning models.
     	`workout_df.csv`: Recommended workouts for diseases.

    Model
         - `RandomForest.pkl`: Trained Random Forest model for disease prediction.

     Templates
           - `index.html`: A Frontend interface for the Disease Prediction System.

    Static
          - `bgCover.jpg`, `img.png` : Images utilized in the frontend webpage.

How to Run the Project
To run the Disease Prediction and Medical Recommendation System:

1         Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn flask ast numpy fuzzywuzzy pickle

2.         Go to the project directory:
         ```bash
         cd ML_project

3.          Start the Flask application
           ```bash
           python main.py

4.          Access the web interface in your browser at:
           ```bash
        http://localhost:5000

		alternatively this application is also hosted and can be accessde via the link:
